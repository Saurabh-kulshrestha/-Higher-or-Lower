# 📊 Higher or Lower: Follower Face-Off (Python Console Game)

**Higher or Lower** is a Python-based terminal game where you test your knowledge of celebrities' social media popularity. Guess who has more followers between two personalities and climb the score ladder. It's simple, fun, and a great Python mini-project!
